      I am an algorithmic artist and pen plotter enthusiast, currently completing a master's degree in computer science 
      at Grand Valley State University. My thesis (both a labour of love and the bane of my existence) investigates 
      how evolutionary computation techniques can be leveraged to support the creation of pen plotter artwork. Some of 
      my other research interests include search-based software engineering, procedural content generation, and digital 
      fabrication.

      I am fascinated with the intersection of art, mathematics, and technology. In my practice, I make art by writing code. 
      While these works can exist in a purely digital context, I am particularly fond of pen plotting as a bridge between 
      the digital and the analog. In the creation of a physical drawing, the interactions between pen and paper result in 
      imperfections that give each plotted work a unique and decidedly tangible quality.
